# Megatorrent Vision

## The Mission
To create a truly decentralized, censorship-resistant content distribution platform that incentivizes storage and bandwidth sharing through a novel "Proof-of-Storage" mechanism on the **Bobcoin** blockchain.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
*   **Protocol v1.0**: Stable Blob/Manifest format using AES-GCM encryption.
*   **Reference Client**: Functional Node.js client with Web UI.
*   **Supernode (Java)**: High-performance backend with Reed-Solomon Erasure Coding.
*   **Unified Interface**: Single Web UI controlling both Node.js and Java backends.
*   **Observability**: Real-time Network Topology, Peer Metrics, and System Resources.

## Phase 2: Optimization & Intelligence (Active)
*   **Smart Ingest**: User-configurable redundancy (Erasure Coding vs. Replication).
*   **Resource Management**: AI-driven capacity planning and load throttling.
*   **Blockchain Integration**:
    *   **Wallet**: Full integration with Bobcoin/Solana wallets.
    *   **Incentives**: Automated storage deals and proof submission.
    *   **Bridge**: Seamless interaction with Filecoin and EVM chains.
*   **Transport Intelligence**:
    *   **I2P/Tor**: Deep configuration and routing optimization.
    *   **Multiplexing**: Efficient connection reuse.

## Phase 3: Cluster & Scale (Future)
*   **Supernode Clusters**: Automated clustering of Java nodes for massive scale.
*   **Geo-Distribution**: Smart placement of shards based on latency and cost.
*   **Content Addressing**: Full IPFS compatibility layer.

## Core Values
1.  **Privacy**: Default encryption and optional anonymity (Tor/I2P).
2.  **Performance**: High-throughput I/O and low-latency peering.
3.  **Usability**: "It just works" UI for end-users, powerful APIs for devs.
