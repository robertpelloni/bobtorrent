## Submodule / External Status
| Component | Location | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Bobcoin | `bobcoin/` | Active | Frontend + game stack remains the primary UI reference; now includes Go storage WASM workbench, publication flow, browser-side retrieval/reconstruction, signed Go-lattice manifest anchoring, a searchable trust-aware Vault archive browser, archive reuse inside Market/Gallery flows, signed publisher provenance metadata, degraded recovery diagnostics, saved/grouped archive workflows, publisher profile/proof overlays, exportable recovery reports, failure/source attribution, portable preset/batch archive actions, long-horizon source reliability trends, structured publisher attestations, exportable comparative source diagnostics, and Go-first HTTP + signaling routing (`v8.67.0`). |
| qBittorrent fork | `qbittorrent/` | Blocked | Local files exist, but remote repo reference remains unreachable. |
| Forest research | `bobcoin/research/forest` | Blocked | Nested submodule metadata issue remains unresolved upstream/local. |
| Solana research | `bobcoin/research/solana` | Blocked | Nested submodule metadata issue remains unresolved upstream/local. |

## Go Service Matrix
| Service | Artifact | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---:|---|
| DHT Proxy | `build/dht-proxy` | Buildable | Privacy-preserving peer discovery with GeoIP sorting |
| Lattice Node | `build/lattice-go` | Buildable | Go asynchronous block lattice + websocket event feed with SQLite-backed replay persistence, operator-tunable snapshot cadence/retention, persistence verification/repair endpoints, backup/export controls, import/restore controls, signed/encrypted operator backup bundle workflows, and broader mixed-transition replay regression coverage |
| Supernode | `build/supernode-go` | Buildable | Tracker, DHT, seeding, market automation, TUI, Bobcoin UI-compatible status/economy/proof/FHE-oracle/control endpoints, websocket matchmaking/signaling with liveness telemetry, Lotus Filecoin bridge status/deal endpoints, WASM artifact serving, manifest/shard publication registry, and durable local transaction logging |
| Storage WASM | `build/storage.wasm` | Buildable | Browser-side Go storage kernel |
| Go WASM Runtime | `build/wasm_exec.js` | Packaged | Required runtime bridge for browser execution |

## Current Go Port Capabilities
- HTTP and UDP tracker support
- Kademlia DHT wrapper via `anacrolix/dht`
- GeoIP-enriched DHT proxy responses
- Block lattice consensus in Go
- Governance / NFT / staking / swap block types in Go lattice engine
- WebSocket live block feed
- Terminal operations dashboard
- Browser-consumable storage WASM runtime

## Current Known Gaps
- Lattice persistence now includes a durable confirmed-block log, materialized snapshot acceleration, conservative snapshot repair tooling, backup/export controls, and import/restore workflows, but operator-tunable snapshot controls and signed/encrypted backup bundles are still missing
- Filecoin bridge is simulated, not production RPC-backed
- qBittorrent remote reference remains broken
